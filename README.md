Hello, sorry the last class was so terrible. Hopefully this one goes better :)

...It's still probably going to be rough but hang in there! :) sorry!

You should not fork and clone this repo because you should practice creating your own but if you do. You will need to create an img folder and move images into it in order to use it in your mockups

In this repo, there are multiple branches that have a "solution" for the mockups I shared in the slack channel. Really they're just a getting started guide for learning HTMl. I am sure you can do better than the work that is presented here. Try to practice everything Daniel and I tried to demonstrate because these skills all work together and you can do it! Use the terminal more rather using the GUI. Use git to have different versions of your code rather than copying and pasting all of your code into a separate document. For right now, allow yourself to focus just on the HTMl and don't worry about how it looks. I know this is hard for me too but it's appropriate.


Here is a link to the onenote where you can copy and paste the structure and content and use it as a cheatsheet to help you do things.

The onenote basically has everything in it you should try to master before the end of the program. We will use it as a working document when we expand our skill set.
